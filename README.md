# DSH-Phase2-Group1
The Adult Dataset

### Session 2

1. Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them [...], it is also important to conduct a thorough check the dataset for noisy data, inconsistencies, and duplicate entries, and to apply the necessary measures.
2. The dataset contains categorical features that need to be converted to numerical values [...] : one-hot encoding, label encoding, and binary encoding. You can identify any additional techniques [...] .
3. How can you scale the continuous features in your dataset? Consider using techniques such as min-max scaling and normalization.
4. Check for outliers in the dataset features and handle them using appropriate techniques like removing outliers, imputation, winsorization, transformation, and bin binning.
5. Analyse the dataset and determine if the target variable 'class' is balanced or not. If it is not balanced, you need to balance it using appropriate techniques like oversampling or under-sampling.
6. Analyse the dataset and create new features/derived features. [...] This can help the model better capture patterns.
7. Identify the relevant features that are likely to have a significant impact on the target variable and the irrelevant or redundant features from the dataset that may not contribute much to the prediction task.
